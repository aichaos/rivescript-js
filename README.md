# RiveScript-JS

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/aichaos/rivescript-js.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/aichaos/rivescript-js)

## INTRODUCTION

This is a RiveScript interpreter library for JavaScript. RiveScript is a
scripting language for chatterbots, making it easy to write trigger/response
pairs for building up a bot's intelligence.

This library can be used both in a web browser or as a Node module.
See the `eg/` folder for examples.

## NOTICE: CHANGES IN v2.0.0

RiveScript v2.0.0 comes with a **massive** refactor of the codebase to
implement modern Async/Await features all throughout. The refactor now
allows features like "storing user variables directly in Redis" or
"using asynchronous macros in conditionals"

But it necessarily had to break some backwards compatibility -- slightly!
-- by turning previously synchronous functions like `reply()` into
async ones that return Promises like `replyAsync()` did.

See the [Upgrading-v2](https://github.com/aichaos/rivescript-js/blob/master/Upgrading-v2.md) document for information on the changes
and how to fix your code for the new version.

## USAGE

```javascript
var bot = new RiveScript();

// Load a directory full of RiveScript documents (.rive files). This is for
// Node.JS only: it doesn't work on the web!
bot.loadDirectory("brain").then(loading_done).catch(loading_error);

// Load an individual file.
bot.loadFile("brain/testsuite.rive").then(loading_done).catch(loading_error);

// Load a list of files all at once (the best alternative to loadDirectory
// for the web!)
bot.loadFile([
  "brain/begin.rive",
  "brain/admin.rive",
  "brain/clients.rive"
]).then(loading_done).catch(loading_error);

// All file loading operations are asynchronous, so you need handlers
// to catch when they've finished. If you use loadDirectory (or loadFile
// with multiple file names), the success function is called only when ALL
// the files have finished loading.
function loading_done() {
  console.log("Bot has finished loading!");

  // Now the replies must be sorted!
  bot.sortReplies();

  // And now we're free to get a reply from the brain!

  // RiveScript remembers user data by their username and can tell
  // multiple users apart.
  let username = "local-user";

  // NOTE: the API has changed in v2.0.0 and returns a Promise now.
  bot.reply(username, "Hello, bot!").then(function(reply) {
    console.log("The bot says: " + reply);
  });
}

// It's good to catch errors too!
function loading_error(error, filename, lineno) {
  console.log("Error when loading files: " + error);
}
```

The distribution of RiveScript.js includes an interactive shell for testing your
RiveScript bot, `shell.js`. Run it with Node and point it to a folder where you
have your RiveScript documents. Example:

```bash
node shell.js eg/brain
```

Once inside the shell you can chat with the bot using the RiveScript files in
that directory. For simple debugging you can type `/eval` to run single lines
of JavaScript code. See `/help` for more.

Both shell scripts accept command line parameters:

* `--debug`: enables verbose debug logging.
* `--watch`: watch the reply folder for changes and automatically reload the
  bot when files are modified.
* `--utf8`: enables UTF-8 mode.

When using RiveScript.js as a library, the synopsis is as follows:

## DOCUMENTATION

There is generated Markdown and HTML documentation of the modules in the
[docs](https://github.com/aichaos/rivescript-js/tree/master/docs) folder.
The main module is at [rivescript](https://github.com/aichaos/rivescript-js/blob/master/docs/rivescript.md).

Also check out the [**RiveScript Community Wiki**](https://github.com/aichaos/rivescript/wiki)
for common design patterns and tips & tricks for RiveScript.

## INSTALLATION

For nodejs and other similar JavaScript engines, you can install this module
through npm:

`npm install rivescript`

For the web you can use the unpkg:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/rivescript@latest/dist/rivescript.min.js"></script>
```

The git repository for this project includes ES2015+ source code. For
ES5 builds targeting older browsers and Node versions, check the
[Releases](https://github.com/aichaos/rivescript-js/releases) tab. The compiled
distribution includes a `lib/` directory with ES5 sources to use with
node <= 6, and a `dist/` directory containing a "browserified" script that can be
used on a web page.

To use on the web, just load `dist/rivescript.min.js` with a `<script>` tag
like usual.

## EXAMPLES

There are examples available in the
[eg/](https://github.com/aichaos/rivescript-js/tree/master/eg) directory of
this project on GitHub that show how to interface with a RiveScript bot in
a variety of ways--such as through a web browser or a telnet server--and other
code snippets and useful tricks.

## RIVESCRIPT PLAYGROUND

For testing and sharing RiveScript snippets that use the JavaScript
implementation, check out the [RiveScript Playground](https://play.rivescript.com/).

It's a JSFiddle style web app for playing with RiveScript in your web browser
and sharing code with others.

## UTF-8 SUPPORT

Version 1.0.5 adds **experimental** support for UTF-8 in RiveScript documents.
It is disabled by default. Enable it by passing a `true` value for the `utf8`
option in the constructor.

By default (without UTF-8 mode on), triggers may only contain basic ASCII
characters (no foreign characters), and the user's message is stripped of all
characters except letters, numbers and spaces. This means that, for example,
you can't capture a user's e-mail address in a RiveScript reply, because of the
@ and . characters.

When UTF-8 mode is enabled, these restrictions are lifted. Triggers are only
limited to not contain certain metacharacters like the backslash, and the user's
message is only stripped of backslashes and HTML angled brackets (to protect
from obvious XSS if you use RiveScript in a web application). Additionally,
common punctuation characters are stripped out, with the default set being
`/[.,!?;:]/g`. This can be overridden by providing a new `RegExp` object as the
`rs.unicodePunctuation` attribute. Example:

```javascript
// Make a new bot with UTF-8 mode enabled.
var bot = new RiveScript({utf8: true});

// Override the punctuation characters that get stripped from the
// user's message.
bot.unicodePunctuation = new RegExp(/[.,!?;:]/g);
```

The `<star>` tags in RiveScript will capture the user's "raw" input, so you
can write replies to get the user's e-mail address or store foreign characters
in their name.

This has so far only been tested when run under Node. When served through a
web server, take extra care that your server sends the correct content encoding
with the RiveScript source files (`Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8`).

One caveat to watch out for in UTF-8 mode is that punctuation characters are not
removed from a user's message, so if they include commas or exclamation marks
it can impact the matching ability of your triggers (you should *absolutely
not* write an explicit punctuation mark on your trigger's side. Triggers should
NOT contain symbols like `?` or `,` even with UTF-8 mode enabled, and while that
may work right now, a future update will probably rigidly enforce this).

## BUILDING

I use npm run scripts to handle various build tasks.

* `npm run build` - Compiles the ES2015+ sources from `src/` with Babel and
  outputs them into `lib/`
* `npm run test` - Builds the source with Babel per above, builds the ES2015+
  test scripts in `test/` and outputs them into `test.babel/` and then runs
  `nodeunit` on it.
* `npm run dist` - Produces a full distributable build. Source is built with
  Babel and then handed off to webpack and uglify for browser builds.
* `npm run webpack` - Creates `dist/rivescript.js` from the ES2015+ sources
  directly from `src/` (using `babel-loader`). This command is independent from
  `npm run build` and could be run without leaving any ES5 code sitting around.
* `npm run uglify` - Minifies `dist/rivescript.js` to `dist/rivescript.min.js`
* `npm run clean` - Clean up all the build files.

If your local Node version is >= 7 (supports Async/Await), you can run the
ES2015+ sources directly without needing to run any npm scripts. For that
purpose, I have a Makefile.

* `make setup` - sets up the dev environment, installs dependencies, etc.
* `make run` - runs `shell.js` pointed at the example brain. This script runs
  natively on the ES2015+ sources, no build steps needed.
* `make test` - runs `nodeunit` on the ES2015+ test sources directly without
  building them as `npm run test` would.

## PUBLISHING

Steps for the npm maintainer of this module:

1. Increment the version number in `package.json` and `src/rivescript.js`
2. Add a change log notice to `Changes.md`
3. Run `npm run dist` to build the ES5 sources and run unit tests.
3. Test a local installation from a different directory
   (`npm install ../rivescript-js`)
4. `npm login` if it's the first time on a new system, and `npm publish` to
   publish the module to NPM.
5. Create compiled zip and tarballs for GitHub releases:
  * Copy git repo to a new folder.
  * `rm -rf .git node_modules` to remove cruft from the new folder.
  * `zip -r rivescript-js-VERSION.zip rivescript-js`
  * `tar -czvf rivescript-js-VERSION.tar.gz rivescript-js`
