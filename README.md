# RiveScript-JS

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/aichaos/rivescript-js.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/aichaos/rivescript-js)

## INTRODUCTION

This is a RiveScript interpreter library for JavaScript. RiveScript is a
scripting language for chatterbots, making it easy to write trigger/response
pairs for building up a bot's intelligence.

This library can be used both in a web browser or as a Node module.
See the `eg/` folder for examples.

## DOCUMENTATION

[Documentation](https://github.com/aichaos/rivescript-js/tree/master/docs) for
the module's API is available in the `docs/` directory and is browseable in
Markdown and HTML format.

## INSTALLATION

For nodejs and other similar JavaScript engines, you can install this module
through npm:

`npm install rivescript`

The GitHub repository for this project only includes the CoffeeScript sources.
To download a compiled JavaScript release of this library, check the
[Releases](https://github.com/aichaos/rivescript-js/releases) tab. The compiled
distribution includes a `lib/` directory with JavaScript sources to use with
node, and a `dist/` directory containing a "browserified" script that can be
used on a web page.

To use on the web, just load `dist/rivescript.min.js` with a `<script>` tag
like usual.

## EXAMPLES

There are examples available in the
[eg/](https://github.com/aichaos/rivescript-js/tree/master/eg) directory of
this project on GitHub that show how to interface with a RiveScript bot in
a variety of ways--such as through a web browser or a telnet server--and other
code snippets and useful tricks.

## USAGE

The distribution of RiveScript.js includes an interactive shell for testing your
RiveScript bot, `shell.js`. Run it with Node and point it to a folder where you
have your RiveScript documents. Example:

```bash
node shell.js eg/brain
```

There is also a CoffeeScript version of `shell.js` which works the same way. The
key difference is that when running the Coffee version, RiveScript object macros
written in CoffeeScript may be used (for example, see `eg/brain/coffee.rive`).

```bash
coffee shell.coffee eg/brain
```

Once inside the shell you can chat with the bot using the RiveScript files in
that directory. For simple debugging you can type `/eval` to run single lines
of JavaScript code. See `/help` for more.

When using RiveScript.js as a library, the synopsis is as follows:

```javascript
var bot = new RiveScript();

// Load a directory full of RiveScript documents (.rive files). This is for
// Node.JS only: it doesn't work on the web!
bot.loadDirectory("brain", loading_done, loading_error);

// Load an individual file.
bot.loadFile("brain/testsuite.rive", loading_done, loading_error);

// Load a list of files all at once (the best alternative to loadDirectory
// for the web!)
bot.loadFile([
	"brain/begin.rive",
	"brain/admin.rive",
	"brain/clients.rive"
], loading_done, loading_error);

// All file loading operations are asynchronous, so you need handlers
// to catch when they've finished. If you use loadDirectory (or loadFile
// with multiple file names), the success function is called only when ALL
// the files have finished loading.
function loading_done (batch_num) {
	console.log("Batch #" + batch_num + " has finished loading!");

	// Now the replies must be sorted!
	bot.sortReplies();

	// And now we're free to get a reply from the brain!
	var reply = bot.reply("local-user", "Hello, bot!");
	console.log("The bot says: " + reply);
}

// It's good to catch errors too!
function loading_error (batch_num, error) {
	console.log("Error when loading files: " + error);
}
```

## DOCUMENTATION

There is generated Markdown and HTML documentation of the modules in the
[docs](https://github.com/aichaos/rivescript-js/tree/master/docs) folder.
The main module is at
[rivescript](https://github.com/aichaos/rivescript-js/blob/master/docs/rivescript.md).

## UTF-8 SUPPORT

Version 1.0.5 adds **experimental** support for UTF-8 in RiveScript documents.
It is disabled by default. Enable it by passing a `true` value for the `utf8`
option in the constructor.

By default (without UTF-8 mode on), triggers may only contain basic ASCII
characters (no foreign characters), and the user's message is stripped of all
characters except letters, numbers and spaces. This means that, for example,
you can't capture a user's e-mail address in a RiveScript reply, because of the
@ and . characters.

When UTF-8 mode is enabled, these restrictions are lifted. Triggers are only
limited to not contain certain metacharacters like the backslash, and the user's
message is only stripped of backslashes and HTML angled brackets (to protect
from obvious XSS if you use RiveScript in a web application). Additionally,
common punctuation characters are stripped out, with the default set being
`/[.,!?;:]/g`. This can be overridden by providing a new `RegExp` object as the
`rs.unicodePunctuation` attribute. Example:

```javascript
// Make a new bot with UTF-8 mode enabled.
var bot = new RiveScript({utf8: true});

// Override the punctuation characters that get stripped from the
// user's message.
bot.unicodePunctuation = new RegExp(/[.,!?;:]/g);
```

The `<star>` tags in RiveScript will capture the user's "raw" input, so you
can write replies to get the user's e-mail address or store foreign characters
in their name.

This has so far only been tested when run under Node. When served through a
web server, take extra care that your server sends the correct content encoding
with the RiveScript source files (`Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8`).

One caveat to watch out for in UTF-8 mode is that punctuation characters are not
removed from a user's message, so if they include commas or exclamation marks
it can impact the matching ability of your triggers (you should *absolutely
not* write an explicit punctuation mark on your trigger's side. Triggers should
NOT contain symbols like `?` or `,` even with UTF-8 mode enabled, and while that
may work right now, a future update will probably rigidly enforce this).

## BUILDING

Grunt options:

* `grunt` - Compiles the CoffeeScript in the `src/` folder into JavaScript in
  the `lib/` folder.
* `grunt clean` - Cleans the `lib/` and `dist/` directories.
* `grunt buildclean` - Cleans and rebuilds the project.
* `grunt lint` - Runs CoffeeScript linting.
* `grunt watch` - For development - watches CoffeeScript source files and
  automatically builds them on change.
* `grunt server` - Starts a local web server and opens `eg/chat.html`
  for local testing and demoing.
* `grunt test` - Run unit tests.

## GRUNT CONNECT

This project uses [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) for compiling to minified JS and
also includes a simple web server for local testing and demoing for RiveScript.

Install `nodejs` and `npm` and then:

```bash
$ npm install -g grunt-cli # If you don't already have it
$ npm install              # Install dev dependencies
$ grunt server             # Will start a local web server and open eg/chat.html
```
