# SessionHandler
#
# This is the default session manager used by RiveScript to store and retrieve
# user variables. This session handler just keeps the variables in RAM; if you
# want to provide your own session handler (e.g. to use a database), you can
# program your own handler and pass it into the RiveScript constructor:
#
# ```javascript
# var bot = new RiveScript({
#     sessionHandler: new MySessionHandler()
# })
# ```
#
# Your custom session handler should be a JavaScript object (class) that
# implements the following functions:
#
# * void set (string username, object vars): For setting user variables. The
#   `vars` object is a key/value dictionary mapping user variable names (key)
#   to their values. The values will usually be strings, but can be other types
#   for some internal data structures (e.g. input/reply histories as arrays).
# * string get (string username, [string key]): For retrieving a user variable.
#   Return the string `"undefined"` if the variable doesn't exist. If the `key`
#   parameter is not provided, this should instead return the full object of
#   key/value pairs for the user.
# * object getAll(): Retrieve all user variables for all users. This should
#   return an object where the top-level key is the username, and the values
#   are objects of key/value pairs of that user's variables.
# * void reset (string username): This should delete all variables about the
#   given username.
# * void resetAll(): This should delete all variables about all users.
# * void freeze (string username): Make a snapshot of a user's variables, which
#   can be later restored using `thaw()`.
# * void thaw (string username[, string action]): Restore a user's variables
#   from the frozen snapshot. This should replace *all* their variables with the
#   set that was frozen. The valid options for `action` are:
#   * `thaw`: Restore the variables and delete the frozen copy (default).
#   * `discard`: Don't restore the variables, just delete the frozen copy.
#   * `keep`: After restoring the user's variables, keep the frozen copy around
#     anyway (e.g. so future calls to `thaw()` will keep restoring the same
#     set of variables).
#
# All class methods are optional, and RiveScript won't attempt to call them if
# they haven't been implemented.
