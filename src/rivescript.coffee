# Notice to Developers
#
# The methods prefixed with the word "private" *should not be used* by you. They
# are documented here to help the RiveScript library developers understand the
# code; they are not considered 'stable' API functions and they may change or
# be removed at any time, for any reason, and with no advance notice.
#
# The most commonly used private function I've seen developers use is the
# `parse()` function, when they want to load RiveScript code from a string
# instead of a file. **Do not use this function.** The public API equivalent
# function is `stream()`. The parse function will probably be removed in the
# near future.

# RiveScript (hash options)
#
# Create a new RiveScript interpreter. `options` is an object with the
# following keys:
#
# ```
# * bool debug:     Debug mode               (default false)
# * int  depth:     Recursion depth limit    (default 50)
# * bool strict:    Strict mode              (default true)
# * bool utf8:      Enable UTF-8 mode        (default false, see below)
# * bool forceCase: Force-lowercase triggers (default false, see below)
# * func onDebug:   Set a custom handler to catch debug log messages (default null)
# * obj  errors:    Customize certain error messages (see below)
# * str  concat:    Globally replace the default concatenation mode when parsing
#                   RiveScript source files (default `null`. be careful when
#                   setting this option if using somebody else's RiveScript
#                   personality; see below)
# ```
#
# ## UTF-8 Mode
#
# In UTF-8 mode, most characters in a user's message are left intact, except for
# certain metacharacters like backslashes and common punctuation characters like
# `/[.,!?;:]/`.
#
# If you want to override the punctuation regexp, you can provide a new one by
# assigning the `unicodePunctuation` attribute of the bot object after
# initialization. Example:
#
# ```javascript
# var bot = new RiveScript({utf8: true});
# bot.unicodePunctuation = new RegExp(/[.,!?;:]/g);
# ```
#
# ## Force Case
#
# This option to the constructor will make RiveScript lowercase all the triggers
# it sees during parse time. This may ease the pain point that authors
# experience when they need to write a lowercase "i" in triggers, for example
# a trigger of `i am *`, where the lowercase `i` feels unnatural to type.
#
# By default a capital ASCII letter in a trigger would raise a parse error.
# Setting the `forceCase` option to `true` will instead silently lowercase the
# trigger and thus avoid the error.
#
# Do note, however, that this can have side effects with certain Unicode symbols
# in triggers, see [case folding in Unicode](https://www.w3.org/International/wiki/Case_folding).
# If you need to support Unicode symbols in triggers this may cause problems with
# certain symbols when made lowercase.
#
# ## Global Concat Mode
#
# The concat (short for concatenation) mode controls how RiveScript joins two
# lines of code together when a `^Continue` command is used in a source file.
# By default, RiveScript simply joins them together with no symbols inserted in
# between ("none"); the other options are "newline" which joins them with line
# breaks, or "space" which joins them with a single space character.
#
# RiveScript source files can define a *local, file-scoped* setting for this
# by using e.g. `! local concat = newline`, which affects how the continuations
# are joined in the lines that follow.
#
# Be careful when changing the global concat setting if you're using a RiveScript
# personality written by somebody else; if they were relying on the default
# concat behavior (didn't specify a `! local concat` option), then changing the
# global default will potentially cause formatting issues or trigger matching
# issues when using that personality.
#
# I strongly recommend that you **do not** use this option if you intend to ever
# share your RiveScript personality with others; instead, explicitly spell out
# the local concat mode in each source file. It might sound like it will save
# you a lot of typing by not having to copy and paste a `! local concat` option,
# but it will likely lead to misbehavior in your RiveScript personality when you
# give it to somebody else to use in their bot.
#
# ## Custom Error Messages
#
# You can provide any or all of the following properties in the `errors`
# argument to the constructor to override certain internal error messages:
#
# * `replyNotMatched`: The message returned when the user's message does not
#   match any triggers in your RiveScript code.
#
#   The default is "ERR: No Reply Matched"
#
#   **Note:** the recommended way to handle this case is to provide a trigger of
#   simply `*`, which serves as the catch-all trigger and is the default one
#   that will match if nothing else matches the user's message. Example:
#
#   ```
#   + *
#   - I don't know what to say to that!
#   ```
# * `replyNotFound`: This message is returned when the user *did* in fact match
#   a trigger, but no response was found for the user. For example, if a trigger
#   only checks a set of conditions that are all false and provides no "normal"
#   reply, this error message is given to the user instead.
#
#   The default is "ERR: No Reply Found"
#
#   **Note:** the recommended way to handle this case is to provide at least one
#   normal reply (with the `-` command) to every trigger to cover the cases
#   where none of the conditions are true. Example:
#
#   ```
#   + hello
#   * <get name> != undefined => Hello there, <get name>.
#   - Hi there.
#   ```
# * `objectNotFound`: This message is inserted into the bot's reply in-line when
#   it attempts to call an object macro which does not exist (for example, its
#   name was invalid or it was written in a programming language that the bot
#   couldn't parse, or that it had compile errors).
#
#   The default is "[ERR: Object Not Found]"
# * `deepRecursion`: This message is inserted when the bot encounters a deep
#   recursion situation, for example when a reply redirects to a trigger which
#   redirects back to the first trigger, creating an infinite loop.
#
#   The default is "ERR: Deep Recursion Detected"
#
# These custom error messages can be provided during the construction of the
# RiveScript object, or set afterwards on the object's `errors` property.
#
# Examples:
#
# ```javascript
# var bot = new RiveScript({
#    errors: {
#        replyNotFound: "I don't know how to reply to that."
#    }
# });
#
# bot.errors.objectNotFound = "Something went terribly wrong.";
# ```

  #
  # Fetch a reply from the RiveScript brain. The message doesn't require any
  # special pre-processing to be done to it, i.e. it's allowed to contain
  # punctuation and weird symbols. The username is arbitrary and is used to
  # uniquely identify the user, in the case that you may have multiple
  # distinct users chatting with your bot.
  #
  # The optional `scope` parameter will be passed down into any JavaScript
  # object macros that the RiveScript code executes. If you pass the special
  # variable `this` as the scope parameter, then `this` in the context of an
  # object macro will refer to the very same `this` as the one you passed in,
  # so for example the object macro will have access to any local functions
  # or attributes that your code has access to, from the location that `reply()`
  # was called. For an example of this, refer to the `eg/scope` directory in
  # the source distribution of RiveScript-JS.
  #
  # The option `skipBegin` parameter can be used to skip any begin blocks.
  # This is useful for when calling reply from within a macro (when begin
  # has already been processed) or when executing a system call where the
  # implementor purposefully wishes to avoid the begin block.

  ##
  # Promise replyAsync (string username, string message [[, scope], callback])
  #
  # Asyncronous version of reply. Use replyAsync if at least one of the subroutines
  # used with the `<call>` tag returns a promise.
  #
  # Example: using promises
  #
  # ```javascript
  # rs.replyAsync(user, message).then(function(reply) {
  #   console.log("Bot>", reply);
  # }).catch(function(error) {
  #   console.error("Error: ", error);
  # });
  # ```
  #
  # Example: using the callback
  #
  # ```javascript
  # rs.replyAsync(username, msg, this, function(error, reply) {
  #   if (!error) {
  #     console.log("Bot>", reply);
  #   } else {
  #     console.error("Error: ", error);
  #   }
  # });
