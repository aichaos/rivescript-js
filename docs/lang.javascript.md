# JSObjectHandler (RiveScript master)

JavaScript Language Support for RiveScript Macros. This support is enabled by
default in RiveScript.js; if you don't want it, override the `javascript`
language handler to null, like so:

```javascript
   bot.setHandler("javascript", null);
```

## void load (string name, string[]|function code)
