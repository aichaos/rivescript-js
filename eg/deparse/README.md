# RiveScript Deparse

This example purely consists of additional documentation and examples of the
`deparse()` method of RiveScript.

## Relevant Methods

* `object rs.deparse()`

  This method exports the current in-memory representation of the RiveScript
  brain as a JSON-serializable data structure. See [Schema](#schema) for the
  format of this data structure.

* `string rs.stringify([object deparsed])`

  This method converts a data structure like the one from `deparse()` into plain
  text RiveScript source code.

  By default (with no argument passed), this will use the current in-memory
  representation of the RiveScript brain. For example, if you loaded a directory
  of RiveScript files and then called `stringify()` you would get a large text
  blob that contains all the source code of all the files from that directory.
  Note, however, that the formatting of the original reply data might be lost
  because the output from `stringify()` is working backwards from the in-memory
  representation, so for example, comments in the original source code aren't
  preserved and places where `^Continue` was used will instead result in one
  single line of code in the output.

  If you pass in a data structure formatted the same way as the one `deparse()`
  returns, you can stringify that code instead. This way you could
  programmatically generate RiveScript data (for example, from a custom user
  interface for authoring bots) and convert it into valid RiveScript source code
  using this method.

* `void write(string filename[, object deparsed])`

  This method is the next logical extension of `stringify()`: to write the
  RiveScript source code to a file on disk. This method is only available from
  a Node environment where the program has access to write to the filesystem.
  From a web environment, you'd need to use `stringify()` to get the RiveScript
  source and use another method to save it (e.g. sending it in an Ajax request
  to a server-side script).

  Like the `stringify()` method, this defaults to using the current in-memory
  reply data, but you can pass your own deparse-compatible data structure as
  the second argument.

## Schema

The data structure returned by `deparse()` looks like this, annotated:

```yaml
begin:
  global:   map of key/value pairs for `! global` global variable definitions
  var:      map of key/value pairs for `! var` bot variable definitions
  sub:      map of key/value pairs for `! sub` substitution definitions
  person:   map of key/value pairs for `! person` substitution definitions
  array:    map of `! array` names to arrays of their values
  triggers: array of trigger data (see below)
topics:     map of topic names -> array of trigger data under that topic
inherits:   map of topic names -> map of topics that it inherits
includes:   map of topic names -> map of topics that it includes
objects:    source codes of JavaScript object macros*
```

The trigger data is stored in arrays underneath `begin.triggers` (for those in
the `> begin` block) and `topics.$NAME` for triggers under a particular topic,
with the default topic being named "random".

Each trigger is an object with the following schema:

```yaml
trigger:   the plain text trigger
reply:     array of the plain text `-Reply` commands, or `[]`
condition: array of the plain text `*Condition` commands, or `[]`
redirect:  the text of the `@Redirect` command, or `null`
previous:  the text of the `%Previous` command, or `null`
```

\* The `objects` data might contain the source code of JavaScript or
CoffeeScript object macros, but currently seems to be somewhat buggy; macros
defined in JavaScript source code using `rs.setSubrotuine()` will probably
appear here, but it doesn't seem to stringify objects defined inside the
RiveScript source code. I don't recommend relying on this data from `deparse()`.

The schema of the objects would look like:

```yaml
javascript: # the name of the handler, `javascript` or `coffeescript`
  _objects: map of object name -> Function object
```

## Examples

Here are some example code snippets that show what the deparsed data structure
looks like.

* JavaScript Code

  ```javascript
  var bot = new RiveScript();
  bot.loadFile("example.rive", function() {
    bot.sortReplies();

    var deparsed = bot.deparse();
    console.log(JSON.stringify(deparsed, null, 2));
  }
  ```

* RiveScript Code (`example.rive`)

  ```rivescript
  ! version = 1.0

  ! var name = Aiden
  ! var age  = 5

  ! sub what's = what is

  ! array colors = red blue green yellow cyan magenta black white

  > begin
    + request
    - {ok}
  < begin

  + hello bot
  - Hello human.

  + hi robot
  @ hello bot

  + my name is *
  - <set name=<formal>>Nice to meet you, <get name>.
  - <set name=<formal>>Hello, <get name>.

  + what is my name
  * <get name> != undefined => Your name is <get name>.
  - You didn't tell me your name.

  > topic game-global
    + help
    - How to play...
  < topic

  > topic game-room-1 inherits game-global
    + look
    - You're in a room labeled "1".
  < topic

  > object reverse javascript
    var msg = args.join(" ");
    return msg.split("").reverse().join("");
  < object

  + say * in reverse
  - <call>reverse <star></call>
  ```
